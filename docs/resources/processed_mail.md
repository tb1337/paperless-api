# Processed Mail

The `processed_mail` resource is a read-only log of emails that have already been processed by a mail rule. Each entry records the outcome of the import attempt.

## Model

See [`pypaperless/models/mails.py`](https://github.com/tb1337/paperless-api/blob/main/pypaperless/models/mails.py) for all fields and types, and the [Paperless-ngx API docs](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/api/) for the upstream schema.

## Fetch one

```python
entry = await paperless.processed_mail(5)
print(entry.subject)   # "RE: Invoice #1234"
print(entry.status)    # "success"
print(entry.processed) # datetime(2024, 3, 15, 10, 30, ...)
```

## Iterate

```python
async for entry in paperless.processed_mail:
    if entry.status == "failed":
        print(f"Failed: {entry.subject} — {entry.error}")

# Collect all failures
failures = [
    e async for e in paperless.processed_mail
    if e.status == "failed"
]
```

## Permissions

```python
async with paperless.processed_mail.with_permissions():
    entry = await paperless.processed_mail(5)
    print(entry.owner)
```

See [Permissions](../concepts/permissions.md) for details.
